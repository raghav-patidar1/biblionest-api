ðŸ“š BiblioNest â€” A Read-Only Library API with Django REST Framework

**BiblioNest** is a structured, read-only API designed with Django REST Framework to model the dynamic relationships of a library system â€” books, genres, authors, branches, and members â€” using a clean architecture powered by function-based views and advanced serializer techniques.

> Designed as a deep-dive learning project to practice **ModelSerializer**, **Nested Serializer**, **Plain Serializer**, **@property**, **SerializerMethodField**, `ForeignKey`, and `ManyToManyField`, all wrapped in a clean, GET-only API endpoint.
